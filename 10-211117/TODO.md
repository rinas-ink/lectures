Slightly long lecture, about 1:25/1:40.
Definitely not enough time to fully cover DLLs in full.
Show link error during load (not compilation!) under Linux.
04-shared-library: take path to a library as an argument (for consistency with home assignment); demonstrate working directory in CLion
Show what happens if the library is not found under different systems
